# VAC (Virtual Arch Companion)
An AI that can gives recomendations, helps answer your question, or even run a command prompt

This AI I build currently for myself. But you still can follow my installation process in order to learn and make some changes so that it can fit into your needed. Currently this software is on development, there are still bugs, some code blocks aren't optimize, and even there's maybe an error when you try to run this program. So, please use this program with caution knowing that it can type into the command prompt automatically!

```
$ git clone https://github.com/iwansal64/VAC.git

You can choose wheter set up environment or not (recomended) and then wait for it to finish. and you're done!!
