# VAC (Virtual Arch Companion)
An AI that can gives recomendations, helps answer your question, or even run a command prompt

This AI I build currently for myself. But you still can follow my installation process in order to learn and make some changes so that it can fit into your needed. Currently this software is on development, there are still bugs, some code blocks aren't optimized, and maybe there will be an error when running this program. So, please use this program with caution knowing that it can type into the command prompt automatically!

I also don't know if this works with other Linux distribution.. So.. yeah.

## HOW TO SETUP
### 1. Install it on your computer with git clone
```
git clone https://github.com/iwansal64/VAC.git
cd ./VAC
```

### 2. Change setup permission
```
chmod +x ./setup
```

### 3. Run the setup
```
./setup
```

You can choose wheter set up environment or not (recomended) and then wait for it to finish. and you're done!!
You can start using it by typing `vac.sh`

If it doesn't work.. idk man.. it's currently on development too so... :/
